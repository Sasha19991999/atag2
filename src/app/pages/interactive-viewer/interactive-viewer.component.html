        In this mode, extra water is added to rinse all detergent residues from

        ATAG washing machines do not have a rubber door sleeve/door seal. And
        there's a good reason for that. The door seal can break down over time
        and dirt can accumulate in it. By eliminating these, you can now wash
        more hygienically. Our washing machines are equipped with the
        SteelSeal™. Dirt and bacteria don't stand a chance.

        Steam is fresh and convenient. Steam helps freshen up your laundry in no
        time, without the use of detergent. After 20 minutes of steam treatment
        with our Steam Refresh program, there is only a short drying time left
        before you can use your reborn garment. Steam is a very effective and
        gentle way to treat your shirts, jackets and trousers. You can steam
        both natural fibres, such as cotton and linen, and synthetic fabrics.
        The shirt program has an integrated steam function. This function adds
        steam at the end of the wash cycle to smooth out creases and reduce
        creases that may appear on fabrics after spinning.

        amount of detergent is automatically added based on the load, degree of
        soiling, water hardness, program type and temperature. This way you
        always use the right amount, so no more overdosing.

          <b>Hygiene:</b> The hygiene program is designed for all situations
          where a thorough hygienic wash is necessary. It is perfect for home
          cooks looking to clean their aprons, tea towels and other textiles
          that come into contact with raw food. It is also suitable for washing
          baby clothes, bedding and clothing used by people with skin allergies.
          In the latter case, we recommend turning the garments inside out, as
          this will also thoroughly wash out any skin residue or residues of
          skin products. The program is characterized by longer heating
          sequences in combination with additional flushes.

        <li class="list-group-item">
          <b>Pro:</b> This is a fast program, but with a high washing

          <b>Super Rinse TM:</b> Dirt is not good for your clothes, but

          additional flushing function: Super Rinse. This feature is
